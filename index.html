                        <p>Leonard "Leon" Borchardt (April 26, 1862 – death date unknown), better known as Oofty Goofty, was
                            a German sideshow performer who lived in San Francisco, California in the late 19th century and
                            Houston, Texas in the early 20th century.
                        </p>

                        <p>Author Herbert Asbury wrote that he got the name "Oofty Goofty" from a February 1884 appearance at
                            a Market Street sideshow, where he was billed as the "Wild Man of Borneo".</p>

                <p>He was covered from head to toe with road tar, into which horsehair was stuck. This gave him a savage and
                    ferocious appearance. He was then locked in a cage, and people paid a dime to look at the “wild man”
                    supposedly captured in the jungles of Borneo and brought to San Francisco at enormous expense. To add
                    to the realism, large chunks of raw meat were poked between the bars by an attendant, and the wild man
                    gobbled ravenously, occasionally growling, shaking the bars, and yelping, “Oofty goofty! Oofty goofty.”</p>

                <p>Afterwards he worked as baseball team mascot. After losing several games, the baseball team kicked him and
                    made him walk several hundred miles back home.</p>
